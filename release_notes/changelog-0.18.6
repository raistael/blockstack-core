What's New in 0.18.6
==================

Release 0.18.6 brings several minor improvements to Blockstack
Core. It is not a consensus-breaking release.

Release Highlights
------------------

**Subdomain listing**: This release adds two new endpoints:
`/v1/subdomains` - this returns a paginated list of all subdomains.
`/v1/blockchains/:blockchainID/subdomains_count` - this returns the
count of registered subdomains.

**Pending subdomain handling**: This release adds support for
instantaneous subdomain resolution by 301 redirection to
registrar-specified resolver URLs.

Getting Started
---------------

This change _does not_ require a state-upgrade on the blockstack
server, so you will not need to fast-sync to a new state.
